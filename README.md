# Dynamic Actionable Threat Intelligence (DATI)

The goal is to construct a meaningful framework symbiotic cyber intelligence . This can be thought of as an approach to reducing laborious processes, such as manually correlating logs against disparate systems, or human resources allocated to threat feed correlation against critical infrastructure. 

Leveraging Python is desirable, as evolving systems allow interrogation and programming through a stable API (e.g. IBM X-Force Exchange API.) Overtime however, an organization will likely scale with market trends, creating a demand to recalibrate manually constructed symbiotic processes. This rationalizes the need for intelligent symbiotic automation.
