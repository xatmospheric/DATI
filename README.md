# Dynamic Actionable Threat Intelligence (DATI)
### Theoretical Approach to Symbiotic Automation w/ Python

The goal is to construct a meaningful framework for symbiotic cyber intelligence, preferably automating that which tends to be dynamic. This can be thought of as reducing laborious processes, such as manually correlating logs against disparate systems, or human analysis of threat feed correlation against (internal) critical infrastructure, which is seemingly inefficient.

Leveraging Python is desirable, as modern systems allow interrogation and programming through a stable API (e.g. IBM X-Force Exchange.) Overtime however, an organization will likely scale with market trends, creating a demand to recalibrate manually constructed symbiotic processes. This rationalizes the need for intelligent symbiotic automation.
