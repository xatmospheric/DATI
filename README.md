# Dynamic Actionable Threat Intelligence (DATI)

With the rapid proliferation of emerging CTI, OSINT/HUMINT, EDR, SIEM, and other cyber intel solutions, I began brainstorming about an approach to aggregate
the myriad of resources available for the cyber intel community. 

The goal is to construct a framework for meaningful analytical-based symbiosis, enhancing the 
diversity of actionable intelligence. This can be thought of as an approach to reducing laborious processes, such as manually correlating logs against 
disparate systems. Leveraging Python is desirable, as many of the aformentioned systems allow interrogation and programming through a stable API 
(e.g. IBM X-Force Exchange API.) Overtime however, the org will likely scale with market trends, creating a demand to recalibrate manual symbiotic processes. 
This rationalizes the need for symbiotic automation. Thus we will tackle this seemingly abstract issue with the use of a Python framework.
